The preference for boys over girls has corroded the minds of the mountain people, with all their favor and expectations resting on the boys, leaving the girls to face beatings and scoldings. They live in dark and loveless days, and when the family can no longer afford to send girls to school, their parents make them drop out to save money for the boys' education. If the girls are disobedient, they are sold off or married into any family, and once married, they are no longer considered part of their original family. Zhaodi has had enough of this life, enduring it with the hope that one day she can escape the mountains to breathe the freedom in the city. Meanwhile, she silently vows that once she has the ability, she will support her sister and the girls of the mountains in striving for education and owning their lives. She also hopes to join these girls in changing the mountain people's view that favors boys over girls.\n",
