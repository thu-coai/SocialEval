After encountering obstructions while protesting in the legation quarter of Dongjiaomin Lane, the parade proceeded to Cao Rulin's residence at Zhaojialou Alley, where they violently beat the traitorous bureaucrat Zhang Zongxiang and burned Cao's house. The Beiyang Government arrested 32 students, including Xu Deheng. On May 5, major colleges in Beijing announced a strike and sent appeals to all sectors for support.
