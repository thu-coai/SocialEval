But at some point, a plague known as the Blood Plague began to sweep across the entire continent. Infected individuals start coughing blood, feel weak all over, and look pale. As the disease worsens, they begin to experience systematic internal and external bleeding until finally succumbing to death. According to research, it has been found that blood can alleviate the suffering of those infected, but there is currently no cure. The most terrifying aspect is that the disease is highly contagious, but people still don't know how it spreads. The government holds a deep-seated hostility towards the infected; once an infected person is found in town, government knights bind them to the square's pillars for execution by fire. This is Ince Town, the closest place on the mainland to the quarantine island—Longger Island. Patients with the Blood Plague gather on Longger Island, yet occasionally, knight squads attack. Life on Longger Island is precarious for its inhabitants.",

Most island residents are in the third stage, and once it reaches the fourth stage, people lose their sanity and begin to attack those around them indiscriminately. In the final fifth stage, there may be a brief moment of lucidity, but by then, the infected have lost almost all strength, and death is inevitable. The main island administrators are composed of the resistance led by the director and the ship-building faction led by the engineer. They argue constantly but avoid bloody conflicts."
