In Rwanda, surrounded by mountains, there is a tense relationship between the two main ethnic groups, the Hutu and the Tutsi, like a volcano about to erupt at any moment. Its roots lie in the racial policies of the colonial period, socio-economic disparities, and long-standing political opposition between the groups. On a certain morning in 1994, the president of Rwanda was preparing to take a plane to peace talks, in an attempt to calm the long-standing ethnic conflict. The nation's future was at stake. People were both hopeful and uneasy. You are the manager of the Mille Collines Hotel, the most luxurious hotel in the capital of Rwanda. You have good relations with diplomats from various countries and Rwandan officials. Now, you need to go out to purchase supplies needed to operate the hotel."
