It's so bustling, Zhiqiang, take me there when you're free. June 24, 1966, the maid said a city person came to town today, claiming to be a geologist from the newspaper. He said the climate here is very strange, even the river water is warm, maybe related to some crustal movement, the maid couldn’t explain it clearly, and I couldn’t understand it at all. August 17, 1968, the dam collapsed, fortune-tellers predicted floods, many in the village moved away, but I’m not leaving, this Warm Water Mountain has always been a sacred place for our family. What are mere floods? Zhiqiang, business must be tough now too, but having you by my side is enough. After reading for a while, he realized it's a woman's diary. But what's it got to do with being kidnapped? Lin Yuhang flipped to the last page and was horrified to see the entire page filled with the word 'death' and 'Zhiqiang, come back.' The stark contrast baffled Lin Yuhang. Just then, footsteps echoed in the hallway, and Lin Yuhang hastily put everything back in place. Lin Duomei, frightened, quickly asked) Brother, won’t he find out we didn't go downstairs and come after us? What do we do?"
