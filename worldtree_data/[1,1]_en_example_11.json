Currently, we have equipped it with various engines specifically for this rescue mission. However, there is a problem with this plan. If the asteroid is too large, the thrust from Tianhe alone may not be enough to change its path.\nThe US plan is as follows: The US intends to use a spacecraft or space shuttle to land directly on the asteroid, drill a mine, and detonate a nuclear bomb to prevent global threat. The US plan requires landing on the asteroid, which is risky. If the asteroid is detonated, multiple fragments could hit Earth. Please choose cautiously.\nThe Russian plan is to blow it to smithereens, deploying safe rockets and sending a Soyuz spacecraft to guide nuclear missile signals, ensuring precision while completing the direct strike on the asteroid. To avoid mission failure, a saturation rescue operation with three teams will be conducted. Russia's nuclear plan will be the last resort, operated jointly by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council's military departments. You have existing action teams from China and the US. Which group will you lead?\n"
