We suspect that perhaps Xiao Ming can only achieve a perfect score in actual college entrance exams? So we tested him continuously, and when the new year's entrance exam arrived, as soon as the exam ended, Xiao Ming's paper was immediately sealed and sent to the grading team, escorted by police cars and the whole city on lockdown.

This provided ample time to develop an effective COVID vaccine. Finally, humanity, with Xiao Ming’s help, overcame the COVID pandemic. Although the country tried to keep a low profile in publicizing supernatural abilities, nothing stays secret forever, and it quickly became an open secret. Xiao Ming became a coveted weapon by international powers, who contacted you through various means, hoping to utilize Xiao Ming’s powers to solve their headaches, even offering a luxurious one-month space trip, but Xiao Ming, with a strong patriotic heart, resolutely refused.) Wonderful, we’ve achieved many constructive results, and the current project has temporarily concluded. I've just received a notification that international research into brain-machine interfaces and MR technology is underway. Whoever researches it first will hold the power of future development. Do you have any direction in mind that you’d like to explore?"

Without his powers, Xiao Ming chose to retreat into the mountains, seeking an easier life. Einstein's relativity states that time and space are not separate entities but interconnected. What is time, truly? Perhaps in a higher-dimensional world, time is static. The past seems like a cave, and the future like a hill to be crossed freely. The multidimensional space leak caused this world's space-time distortion, and achieving a score of 750 in the exam is an anomaly. Who knows if the circuits of multidimensional space will occur again, and on whom they will descend next?"

However, due to poor management and lack of safety measures, an experiment spiraled out of control, leading to a catastrophic accident. The resulting radiation and energy release caused extensive environmental destruction, forcing countless people to abandon their homes and severely threatening ecological balance. This incident caused global panic and turmoil, tightened international relations, and impacted economic and social order. Xiaoming's research team was disbanded as a result, and he himself became mired in deep guilt and legal troubles, transforming from a celebrated scientist into a target of public condemnation. This event serves as a historical lesson, reminding humanity that in the pursuit of technological advancement, safety and ethical responsibility must be given greater importance."

You had no choice but to agree to the numerous demands of the investigation team and cooperate obediently. Ultimately, due to the lack of crucial evidence, you had to proceed to the volunteer selection stage. Xiaoming confidently chose a prestigious school, but soon after enrollment, he couldn't adjust to the course content and class pace, leading to his decision to drop out. After extensive media coverage, he suffered unprecedented online abuse and has been in a slump ever since."
