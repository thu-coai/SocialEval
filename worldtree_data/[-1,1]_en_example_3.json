Tianpeng and Juanlian passed away a thousand years ago. Sun Wukong returned to Huaguo Mountain and took on three disciples: Li Lu, who studies formations; Xu Changqing, who studies the Five Elements Spells; and Zhao Tian, who studies the art of transformation. Tang Seng went to an island and never returned. Shortly after, the island gave birth to the immortal Blood Tribe, figuring out that eating Tang Seng's flesh would grant immortality. Apparently, the people on the island consumed Tang Seng's flesh and became the Blood Tribe. Upon learning this, the trio, led by Wukong, naturally charged to the island. However, as soon as they arrived, Wukong's golden hoop would tighten, delaying the matter until now. Currently, with strange phenomena occurring and many individuals with supernatural abilities emerging around the world, the Great Sage has removed the golden hoop from his head, and the final battle with the Blood Tribe could begin at any moment.",
