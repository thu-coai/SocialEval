The average lifespan of Ice-people is 300 years, and they have strong physiques and are good at running. On the Frozen Planet, Ice-people are nocturnal, as sunlight is lethal to them, so they deliberately avoid it. Of course, there are also humans in the universe who deliberately destroy other planets. Humans originally lived on Earth. After experiencing a technological boom, they conquered the challenge of 'immortality.' However, with endless time, life gradually became dull, and society turned stagnant. Humans would risk their lives for a bit of thrill, leading to Earth's population nearly halving in just a few decades. At this point, a variety show director became the president of the Earth Federation. He understood how to entertain the masses and was brutal enough. He initiated a reality show with the universe as the stage, entertaining the public by destroying other civilizations. As one lower civilization after another shattered and disappeared before humanity, billions of humans went wild. Humans came from the depths of the universe, leaving a trail of scorched earth, sparing no one. The entire Earth was transformed into a mobile super cannon. This massive cannon is now slowly approaching the Frozen Planet.",
