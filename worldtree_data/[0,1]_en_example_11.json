That’s how the head of the snowman Santa Claus turned into a murder weapon. The frozen bloodstains on the scene were not because the blood froze, but from fragments of the weapon that were stained with blood. The reason the weapon couldn’t be found at the scene is because it was thrown into the nearby unfrozen lake and melted.
