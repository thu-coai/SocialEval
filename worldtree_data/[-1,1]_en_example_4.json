At first, Xia Mei thinks she's daydreaming, but as time slowly passes, she starts to feel inexplicably anxious. Under this growing sense of unease, Xia Mei doesn't turn in her phone until a classmate named Liu Li arrives in the classroom and things start feeling increasingly wrong.

The two of them head to the police station to seek help, and with the assistance of a detective named Chen, a shelter at the police station gradually starts to take shape.",
