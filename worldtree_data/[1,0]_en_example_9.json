Will Jacob stands in an empty space, breathing in the fresh air, and glances around; aside from the solitary building behind you, all you see is a wasteland. This seems to be the outskirts of a city, without so much as a streetlamp. The subtle light of dawn falls upon you, and along with it, the scattered joy of escaping women brings a shiver of excitement. The successful scan from mechanical electronics hits you like a sledgehammer to the heart. You look back hesitantly to find the door has quietly closed at some point, leaving only a small house exposed on the surface. If you hadn't just escaped from there, it would be hard to believe that beneath lies a massive entity. Will Jacob, that name rings incredibly familiar in your mind, so am I a part of this bizarre place? A refreshing breeze graces your face, and you calm down for a moment. In the stillness of the night, a multitude of indistinguishable sounds reach your ears, hinting at beings beyond mere imagination in the basement. It's terrifying, hastily, you must leave this place."

You decide to follow these tracks quietly. Struggling through the rain curtain, luckily, the tracks are deep and won't be washed away by the rain anytime soon. Walking in the dark for quite some time, without a timepiece, it's impossible to accurately judge how long you've been walking, and with the wound on your leg wrapped in damp trousers, it's extremely uncomfortable until you finally notice a clear direction, where faint red lights and houses emerge with your advance. The scene gradually comes into focus, revealing a maze of barbed wire enclosing the land beneath your feet, and before you stands a massive door, seemingly operable only by sophisticated machinery. Not far from it, there's a small house with no lights on. Considering the tracks on the ground and Xiao Ni's likelihood of someone being inside, not holding much hope, you notice a flickering red light in your peripheral vision. Looking up, you realize it's on the barbed wire, each section has one. This camera signals the operation of Macro Light's official surveillance cameras. You quickly discover something that sends chills down your spine; as you move, those cameras subtly follow your movements. Someone is on the other side, watching you.) It's horrifying; what do I do?"
