Finding Dadaoni passed out drunk, Aqiang was filled with murderous intent. He found a pair of gloves in Dadaoni's wardrobe, planning to put them on, bind Dadaoni, drown him in the bathtub, and disguise it as an accident. However, fearing that using rope might leave marks, he bound the victim's hands behind his back and used fishing line to tie the buttonholes of his sleeves together. He held the victim face down under the water. After Dadaoni drowned, he quickly cut the fishing line and threw it down the drain. To prevent the body from stiffening in an awkward position, he flipped it over and restored the arms to their original position."

At that moment, Awei's knocking startled you, causing you to hastily place the hairdryer on the sink and prepare to escape. In your hurry, your tall stature caused you to bump your forehead into the doorframe, making you yell in pain and scaring Awei away. Hearing him leave from outside, you sighed in relief, unlocked the front door, ensured no one would notice you from outside, locked it from the inside, closed the door from the outside, and successfully created a locked room. Furthermore, when you left after committing the crime, you inadvertently left the hairdryer on the sink while it was still plugged in.
